# My Password Checker:
 
I created my own simple personal password checker using Python 3 and haveibeenpwned API https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3, to check if any of my passwords have been found leaked online. 

First please install the dependencies for the scraper by using the requirements.txt file:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

You can also use this simple program my cloning my repository and runing ```python3 checkmypass.py [HERE ADD DATABASE OF PASSWORDS]```. The database must have the passwords you want to check in a column called 'password'
